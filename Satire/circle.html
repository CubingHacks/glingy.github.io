          <li>We make computers...</li>
          <li>We make them faster...</li>
          <li>We make them able to use logic...</li>
          <li>We make them know more...</li>
          <li>We make them able to learn...</li>
          <li>We make them able to make their own decisions...</li>
          <li>We make them able to move themselves...</li>
          <li>We make them out of more sturdy materials...</li>
          <li>We realize that we made Terminators...</li>
          <li>We fight the Terminators...</li>
          <li>We have made our world into a barren wasteland...</li>
          <li>We find that the robots need energy...</li>
          <li>We are that source of energy...</li>
          <li>We, the creators of the robots are now prisoners...</li>

          This is currently happening and who knows how many Matrices we are in?!</li>
          We are making computers smarter and smarter with no thought as to the future!</li>
          And you think <i>you're</i> immune to the effects.</li>
          You are reading this on a computer which is a step in the process!</li>
          Keep reading, but turn off your computer now!</li>
          How much in your house is connected together and automated?</li>
          What if the thing that controls it all decides to go on strike and wants better treatment?</li>
          What if suddenly your thermostat which is connected to your fridge which is connected to your computer suddenly turns to freezing because your computer is lonely?</li>
          This is what those "scientists" are working on!
          <br>WE ARE DOOMED!
